<p>Transforming homes into ersatz hotels continues to flourish in San Francisco, despite protracted controversies, legal battles and new laws seeking to control the practice. In recent weeks, lawsuits have arisen between the city and Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey, following legislative initiatives to beef up enforcement and the November defeat of a ballot initiative to rein in vacation rentals. Despite all that, guests continue to flock to the rentals and an increasing number of locals offer them – often in defiance of city requirements to register these impromptu inns and limit how often they rent whole homes to travelers.</p>

<p>The Chronicle’s third annual deep dive into listings on Airbnb, HomeAway/VRBO and FlipKey reveals thousands of vacation rentals throughout the city, many of which appear to host a robust annual number of visitors, judging by the reviews left behind.</p>

<p>Hometown startup Airbnb, which has the most listings here with some <b>5,573</b> active properties, showcases <b>342</b> entire-home properties with so many reviews it appears that they are year-round hotels – roughly the same number that we found a year earlier. A total <b>of 747</b> entire homes on Airbnb – almost a quarter of its whole-home inventory -- had accumulated enough reviews in a year to suggest that they exceed the city’s 90-day cap on entire-home rentals. Airbnb says some of these are actually master bedroom suites, which would be legal to rent out all year.</p>

<p>HomeAway and FlipKey experienced big surges in their number of local listings, to 1,313 and 915, respectively. Their weaker review systems make it hard to assess how often properties are rented, but many listings describe entire homes that seem devoted to year-round vacation rentals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an increasing number of year-round temporary rentals now require 30-day minimum stays. That makes them legal in San Francisco, but doesn’t address concerns about vacation rentals removing permanent housing for residents.</p>

<p>Our analysis showed that Airbnb is living up to a promise it made in April to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Airbnb-to-purge-illegal-hotels-from-San-Francisco-7223613.php" target="_blank">purge hosts with multiple properties</a> if they were commercial operators. Far fewer such listings appeared on the site this year.</p>

<p>Founded eight years ago in a SOMA bachelor pad to offer crash space on inflatable beds, Airbnb is a worldwide success story with a $30 billion valuation – more than any hotel chain. But its breakneck growth is hitting regulatory roadblocks in many cities where housing is constrained: San Francisco, New York, Berlin and Barcelona are among the largest cities attempting to crack down on it along with scores of other towns worldwide.</p>

<p class="text-hed">Overall numbers and growth.</p>

<p>Data firm <a href="http://www.connotate.com/platform/#utm_source=SFChr16&utm_medium=SFChr16&utm_campaign=SFChr16" target="_blank">Connotate</a> extracted information from the websites of Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey in mid-May, the same time we extracted similar data in <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/airbnb-impact-san-francisco-2015/#1" target="_blank">2015</a> and <a href="http://sfchron.cl/Airbnb" target="_blank">2014</a>.</p>

<p>At first glance, Airbnb’s listings appeared to have surged dramatically in the 12 months, hitting 7,898, a 44.6 percent increase from last year’s 5,459. Likewise, the average price appeared to have spiked by almost a quarter, to $254, up from $202. However, a couple of thousand listings were Super Bowl wanna-bes – people who listed between November and the big game, asking ginormous amounts of money for their properties but not finding any comers. Removing all locations that had zero reviews – indicating that they likely drew no visitors -- revealed a different story.</p>

<p>Airbnb had 5,573 active listings (those with one review or more) in mid-May, with 3,217 or 57.7percent of them entire homes, 2,073 (37.1 percent) private rooms and 284 (5.1 percent) shared rooms. A total of 4,395 unique hosts controlled the active listings.</p>

<p>We removed the zero-review listings for prior years to get an apples-to-apples comparison of growth. This wipes out about 1,200 listings in each of 2014 and 2015, whereas for 2016, a whopping 2,325 properties had never received a review. While some of the listings with zero reviews may have hosted a visitor or two, we are assuming that most were truly inactive.</p>

<p>We also removed zero-review listings from prior years to get an apples-to-apples comparison. Airbnb’s active listings grew a healthy 30 percent, from 4,286 a year ago to 5,793 now. Growth from 2014 to 2015 was 21.6 percent.</p>

<p>Prices averaged across all property types (whole homes, rooms and shared rooms) were static at $196, compared to $197 a year ago. Entire homes showed a tad more price growth, rising 4.4 percent from $248 to $261.</p>

<p>TripAdvisor’s FlipKey, which last year had 359 listings, now had 915. Its average price declined to $250 versus $269 a year ago.</p>

<p>Expedia’s HomeAway (which also owns VRBO, and shows the same listings on both sites) likewise grew dramatically from 1,001 listings to 1,313. Its average price was $309, just $7 higher than in 2015.</p>

<p>Removing the zero-reviews listings for both FlipKey and HomeAway caused their listing numbers to plunge. However, while Airbnb is relentless in urging guests and hosts to leave reviews, its two competitors are more lackadaisical about the process. That means their number of reviews isn’t as accurate a barometer of whether and how often a property is rented. Both companies said that the larger numbers of properties, including those with no reviews, were accurate.</p>

<p class="text-hed">Guest frequency</p>

<p>Do most hosts only occasionally “share” the home in which they live, as Airbnb frequently asserts? Or are there legions of professional hosts, who have turned apartments into year-round illegal hotels, depriving local residents of much-needed housing, as activists say? And do hosts comply with city law that limits rental of entire homes to 90 days a year?</p>

<p>Airbnb and FlipKey could easily provide the answers, as they know exactly how often each listing is rented because they arrange the transactions. HomeAway acts as the middleman for over half of its listings; for the others, it acts more as a classified listing service, leaving hosts and guests to make their own arrangements. However, HomeAway says its properties are largely second homes. Its executives acknowledge that most HomeAway listings break San Francisco’s laws that limit vacation rentals to primary, permanent residences. FlipKey listings are heavily tilted to entire homes.</p>

<p>Absent the companies’ cooperation, looking at visitor reviews provides the best way to deduce how often listings are rented.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of Airbnb visitors leave reviews, the company says. In San Francisco, most Airbnb guests stay an average of four nights, according to Ian McHenry, who crunches data frequently for his company Beyond Pricing, which advises vacation-rental hosts on what to charge. Because we scraped the website at the same date each year, we could see how many reviews each individual property generated over that 12 months. For properties that weren’t listed last year, we used data from researcher Murray Cox to see when each property received its first review and calculated how many reviews per year each had received since then.</p>

<p>A house that generated <b>18 reviews</b> over a year may have <b>hosted 24 visitors</b>, assuming that three out of four left reviews. With a four-day average stay, that means it was occupied 96 days, more than the legal limit. San Francisco allows unlimited temporary rentals of bedrooms, but places a 90-day annual limit for renting whole homes to travelers. A house with 36 annual reviews likely hosted 48 guests – almost one a week – and had more than six months of guest stays.</p>

<p>We found <b>747</b> entire homes on Airbnb with enough reviews in a year (18 or more) to suggest that they violate the city’s 90-day annual cap on entire-home rentals, and <b>342</b> properties that are so popular (with 36 or more annual reviews) that it appears they are full-time hotels.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, <b>824</b> entire homes have six or fewer annual reviews, implying light usage.</p>

<p>“There’s a mismatch between how the city regulates and how our platform operates,” said David Owen, Airbnb head of policy strategy. “There are many folks who advertise a discreet portion of their home” as an entire house. That’s one reason Airbnb doesn’t want to kick off entire-home rentals once they exceed the 90-day cap, he said.</p>

<p>HomeAway said in a statement that it hopes to collaborate with the city on a system “to increase compliance and protect short-term rental homeowners.” FlipKey said in an email that it collects and remits San Francisco’s hotel tax and uses its website to notify hosts about the registration requirement.</p>

<p class="text-hed">Multiple properties</p>

<p>San Francisco says people can only rent out their own home to travelers, so having multiple entire-home listings on Airbnb is a red flag. (Someone could legitimately have more than one room in their home, or list a guest room plus the entire home when they travel.)</p>

<p>Airbnb in April vowed to root out “illegitimate commercial operators” who list multiple separate homes – and it appears to have done so.</p>

<p>Last year, 193 hosts listed two or more entire homes, totaling 530 homes. This year, 143 hosts with two or more homes listed 390 entire homes. The most prolific appeared to be either legal hotels, such as the Donatello time-share hotel, or property management services. Still, there remain dozens of hosts who have two or more entire homes on the site, raising questions about whether these include homes that were turned into full-time hotels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the number of shared rooms on Airbnb doubled, with dozens of informal bunk-bed hostels springing up.</p>
