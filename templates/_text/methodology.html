<p><a href="http://www.connotate.com/platform/#utm_source=SFChr16&utm_medium=SFChr16&utm_campaign=SFChr16">Connotate</a>, a Web data extraction firm, created scripts that obtained information on San Francisco listings from the websites of Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey over several hours on May 15 and 16. Connotate removed duplicates and performed other quality-assurance measures, and The Chronicle performed additional analysis.</p>

<p>On all the sites, each listing has a unique property ID number. On Airbnb, each host likewise has a unique ID number, which allows tracking of hosts with multiple properties. Calendar information about when properties were available to rent could not be extracted.</p>

<p>To pinpoint how often properties were rented, we used reviews data. About three-quarters of Airbnb visitors leave reviews, the company says, up from two-thirds last year. In San Francisco, most Airbnb guests stay an average of four nights, according to Ian McHenry. He analyzes such data frequently for his company <a href="http://beyondpricing.com/" target="_blank">Beyond Pricing</a>, which advises vacation-rental hosts on what to charge.</p>

<p>Because we examined Airbnb’s website at the same time each year, we could see how many reviews each individual property generated over the elapsed 12 months. However, many properties cycle on and off Airbnb. For properties that weren’t listed last year, we used data from researcher <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/" target="_blank">Murray Cox</a> to see when each property received its first review and calculated how many annual reviews each had received since then. Cox, a freelance photographer and critic of Airbnb, maintains the <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/" target="_blank">InsideAirbnb.com</a> website, which tracks data on Airbnb in various cities.</p>

<p>A house that generated 18 reviews over a year’s time may have hosted 24 visitors, based on Airbnb’s assertion that 3 out of 4 guests leave reviews. With a four-day average stay, that would mean it was occupied 96 days, more than the legal limit for homes where no host is present. A house with 36 annual reviews likely hosted 48 guests — almost one a week — meaning more than six months of guest stays.</p>

<p>We removed Airbnb listings with zero reviews, after noticing a huge surge in properties that were listed leading up to the 2016 Super Bowl but evidently never rented out. For consistency, we removed the zero-review listings from our <a href="http://sfchron.cl/Airbnb" target="_blank">2014</a> and <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/airbnb-impact-san-francisco-2015" target="_blank">2015</a> data as well.</p>

<p>Removing the zero-reviews listings for both FlipKey and HomeAway caused their listing numbers to plunge. However, while Airbnb is relentless in urging guests and hosts to leave reviews, its two competitors are more lackadaisical. That means reviews aren’t as accurate a barometer of how often a property is rented. Both companies said that the larger numbers of properties, including those with no reviews, were accurate.</p>
